# Alan game

This is my attempt in creating multiplayer space game based on [phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) and one of the examples provided. I refactored the example so it can handle multiplayer

Also based on great tutorial at [ezelia.com](http://ezelia.com/2014/08/tutorial-creating-basic-multiplayer-game-phaser-eureca-io/)

I would like this game to grow to massive multiplay space-trading game.. perhaps one day.

Pull requests are very welcomed

## Installation 

$>npm install

$>node server.js

It should run on http://localhost:8000

Use arrows to move

## Multiplayer

At the moment multiplayer is handled by eureca.io. Player syncing mechanism should be improved
