# Alan game

This is my attempt in creating multiplayer space game based on [phaser.io](http://phaser.io/)

I would like this game to grow to massive multiplay space-trading game.. perhaps some day.

## Installation 

$>npm install

$>node server.js

It should run on http://localhost:8000

Use arrows to move

## Multiplayer

At the moment multiplayer is handled by eureca.io. Player syncing mechanism should be improved
